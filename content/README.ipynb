    "# Jupyter BOAT\n",
    "Jupyter BOAT is a republication of the [bulk open attribution tool](https://xolotl.org/boat-1-0/) that I created, but here using a Jupyter computational notebook environment that enables you to generate open licensing/attribution statements from a list of basic information about a collection of works. For more information about the origin and goals of BOAT, please see [all my BOAT posts](https://xolotl.org/tags/boat/).\n",

    "## License\n",
    "As with my other publications of BOAT, any rights I may have to content, code, and data created by me for Jupyter BOAT are dedicated to the public domain via [CC0 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/). Note that this Jupyter notebook environment as a whole includes works created by others with different intellectual property statuses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using BOAT\n",
    "All BOAT files other than this README.md are located in the \"boat\" folder in this notebook. You can modify and work with BOAT's files starting from [the notebook I published](https://xolotl.org/jupyter-boat/) â€” that's what computational notebooks are for! Or you can visit [the Jupyter BOAT GitHub reposistory](https://github.com/xolotl/jupyter-boat) and review, copy, duplicate, and/or contribute to the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter BOAT is delivered via a standard [Jupyter Lite demo](https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo) deployed as a static GitHub Pages website. The default materials from that demo are included in the notebook along with BOAT. If you know what you are doing, you can likely also use Jupyter BOAT either in an entirely different computational notebook or some other computing enviroment that supports python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BOAT's files\n",
    "There are four files in the boat folder in this notebook that enable Jupyter BOAT to work. You don't have to understand them all to use BOAT, but it might help to know what role each file plays.\n",
    "1. **works.csv**: A comma-delimited list of works for which Jupyter BOAT will generate licensing/attribution statements. You can modify or add to the works in this list. For example, you can put your own collection of works in this file to have BOAT generate licensing/attribution statements for them.\n",
    "1. **ipstatements.csv**: A comma-delimited list of the various intellectual property (IP) statements used in Jupyter BOAT. You can modify or add to the the statements in this list. For example, maybe you'd like to change the wording of the public domain (PD) or all rights reserved (ARR) statements.\n",
    "1. **boat.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook python code that makes Jupyter BOAT work, matching the list of works with the list of intellectual property statements to generate full licensing/attribution statements for those works, delivered when the code runs in various formats using a template. You can change this python code to modify how BOAT works.\n",
    "1. **template.html**: The [jinja template](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) that generates the outputs from the other files in Jupyter BOAT. You can modify this template to change the output generated by Jupyter BOAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "### See BOAT work\n",
    "Jupyter BOAT is designed to function without any modifications to demonstrate how it works. Once you see how it works, it is expected that you would at least provide your own list of works for which you want BOAT to generate licensing/attribution statements. If your works include some with intellectual property statuses that are not already in BOAT's IP statements file, you would need to add new statements to ipstatements.csv. If you would need to make changes to the licensing/attribution statements BOAT generates, you might need to adjust its IP statements file, it's output template, or perhaps even the logic in the BOAT python code file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see BOAT generate output using the example works already listed in the works.csv file, just <a href=\"https://xolotl.github.io/jupyter-boat/lab/index.html?path=boat%2Fboat.ipynb\" target=\"_self\">open the boat.ipynb in this notebook</a> and choose \"Run All Cells\" from the notebook's \"Run\" menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use BOAT on your own collection of works\n",
    "To use BOAT to generate licensing/attribution statements for your own collection of works, just do X and Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Change or add to BOAT's IP statements\n",
    "To modify how BOAT generates the IP statements in its output, you can make changes to the ipstatements.csv file by doing X and Y. You can also add new IP statements to the file. To work as expected, every row in the IP statements file should have a unique value in the \"IP Status\" column that can be used in the works.csv file to link a work to the right IP statement. Each IP status is repeated for each format (eg, html, md, txt, txturl) with a value in the \"IP Snippet\" column that provides the correctly formatted output for works with that IP status (see existing entries for examples).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modify BOAT's output\n",
    "To change BOAT's output, you can modify its template.html file by doing X and Y. When modifying the template, it may be helpful to learn how [jinja templates](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modify BOAT's logic\n",
    "To change how BOAT combines works and ip statements to generate licensing/attribution statements using a template, you can modify its boat.ipynb file by doing X and Y. When modifying the python notebook file, it may be helpful to learn how [python](https://www.python.org/) works.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contribute to BOAT\n",
    "I welcome contributions to BOAT. [Add an issue](https://github.com/xolotl/jupyter-boat/issues/new) or [fork Jupyter BOAT](https://github.com/xolotl/jupyter-boat/fork) and make a pull request via the Jupyter BOAT GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions or suggestions?\n",
    "I welcome your inquiries and input about BOAT: [Add an issue](https://github.com/xolotl/jupyter-boat/issues/new) in the Jupyter BOAT GitHub repository or [contact me](https://xolotl.org/contact/) via my website.\n",
