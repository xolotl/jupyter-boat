# Jupyter BOAT
Jupyter BOAT is a republication of the [bulk open attribution tool](https://xolotl.org/boat-1-0/) that I created, but here using a Jupyter computational notebook environment that enables you to generate open licensing/attribution statements from a list of basic information about a collection of works. For more information about the origin and goals of BOAT, please see [all my BOAT posts](https://xolotl.org/tags/boat/).

See [the full README for Jupyter BOAT](https://github.com/xolotl/jupyter-boat/blob/main/content/README.ipynb).
